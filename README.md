I updated the code that I showed you in Group Meeting #1 as follows:

-- Now a right-click on a node will cycle the other way through the array of colors, making it simpler to go back and forth between two colors as you test your code, and

-- The score now updates every time you change a node color, and the score is displayed directly on the graph's window, so you no longer have to look at the terminal to see how the score is affected by your choices!

-- There's a scoring.jl file (currently just returning 0) that is ready for your scoring function, if you'd like to use it.
